## Dataset
The **Heart Disease UCI Dataset** contains 14 attributes related to patient health metrics (e.g., age, cholesterol levels, chest pain type) and a binary target variable indicating the presence of heart disease.  
**Download Instructions**:
1. Create a Kaggle account [here](https://www.kaggle.com/account/login?phase=startSignInTab&returnUrl=%2F).
2. Navigate and Download the `ronitf/heart-disease-uci` dataset 
3. Unzip the file and place `heart.csv` in the `data/` directory.

## Models Used
The following machine learning models were trained and evaluated

1. Logistic Regression - Optimized for linear decision boundaries.
2. Decision Tree Classifier - Optimized for interpretability and capturing complex patterns.
3. Random Forest Classifier - Optimized for reducing overfitting and improving accuracy.
4. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) - Optimized for non-linear decision boundaries and handling small datasets.

## Preprocessing Steps
- Handling Missing Values Numerical values were imputed using the median, and categorical values were imputed using the most frequent value.
- Feature Scaling Standardization was applied to numerical features.
- Encoding Categorical Data Label encoding was used for categorical variables.
- Train-Test Split The dataset was split into training and testing sets.

## Results
The models were evaluated using accuracy as the primary metric. The obtained results are

- Logistic Regression 83% accuracy
- Decision Tree Classifier 77% accuracy
- Random Forest Classifier 86% accuracy
- KNN Classifier 85% accuracy
